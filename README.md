# MobileFastugaDriver

## About this project
A mobile application for food delivery workers of a fake restaurant called "FasTuga" to track delivery orders and follow directions to destination on a map.
The user (a driver) can login, track and assign/unassign their deliveries and money, see the directions to destinations, and see statistics about their profile, among other things.
Developed in Android Studio with Java, interacts with a noSQL Google Firebase Firestore as a database.
